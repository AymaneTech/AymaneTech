# Hey, I'm Aymane 👋

Just another software engineer reinventing the wheel, nothing revolutionary.

Working as **Associate Software Developer** at [ProgressSoft](https://www.progressoft.com/), working on payment processing systems and financial integrations.

By night, I'm working on personal projects to learn low level programming using C/C++ because apparently that's how I have fun. Currently working through:
- 🔨 Building **clox** – a Lox interpreter in C (because why not)
- 🌍 Planning my own web server, git implementation, and database (the "reinvent the wheel" challenge)

**What I actually know:**
- **Backend:** Java, Kotlin, Spring Boot, payment systems that don't lose money, I used before other technologies like (php, laravel, next.js)
- **Systems:** C, memory management, actually understanding what's happening under the hood
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle (and one day, my own)
- **Tools:** Linux (obviously), Neovim (obviously), Ghostty, fzf, zoxide
- **Devops:** OpenTelemtry, Datadog, and other observability tools, Docker, Podman, Kuburnetes, Git, GitHub Actions, Gitlab CI

**Philosophy:** I love functional programming, and writing tests

*P.S. – If you're also into building things from first principles or have ideas about systems programming, let's talk. I'm always learning.*
