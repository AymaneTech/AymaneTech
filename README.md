# Hey, I'm Aymane 👋

Just another software engineer who refuses to use existing libraries when building things from scratch sounds way more fun.

By day, I'm an **Associate Software Developer** at [ProgressSoft](https://www.progressoft.com/), working on payment processing systems and financial integrations that actually matter.

By night, I'm that person implementing interpreters, web servers, git clones, and databases in C/Java because apparently that's how I have fun. Currently working through:
- 🔨 Building **clox** – a Lox interpreter in C (because understanding how languages work matters)
- 🌍 Planning my own web server, git implementation, and database (the "reinvent the wheel" challenge)
- 💡 Diving deep into low-level systems programming and compilers

**What I actually know:**
- **Backend:** Java, Kotlin, Spring Boot, payment systems that don't lose money
- **Systems:** C, memory management, actually understanding what's happening under the hood
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle (and one day, my own)
- **Tools:** Docker, Git, GitHub Actions, Linux (obviously)

**Philosophy:** Clean code > clever code. Understanding > copy-pasting.

*P.S. – If you're also into building things from first principles or have ideas about systems programming, let's talk. I'm always learning.*
